Karel the Robot resources and exercises (in Java)

This repository contains an Eclipse project for running Karel-the-Robot in Java. Karel is an educational programming language, targetting beginners and fun for anybody. The code comes from the Stanford CS106A Programming Methodology course with an unknown licens (I do not claim any credit). Nowadays a GitHub repository is more convenient to share such resources.
