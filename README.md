===========================

Karel the Robot resources and exercises (in Java)

This repository contains an Eclipse project for running Karel-the-Robot in Java. Karel is an educational programming language, targetting beginners and fun for anybody. The code comes from the Stanford CS106A Programming Methodology course with an unknown licens (I do not claim any credit). Nowadays a GitHub repository is more convenient to share such resources. 

## Quick start

First of all, the ``.jar`` is only comptible with Java 1.6, meaning JRE 1.6 should be installed on your computer.

> Note: Eclipse requires Java also, and the JRE used for Eclipse can be different from the JRE used for Karel. You will probably prefer run Eclipse on the latest Java version.

Java 1.6 is no longer officially supported. It has to be downloaded from the [Java archive page][java-archive]. Run the installer and add it to the Eclipse available JRE.

You can then clone this repository (or fork and clone) and import the project into Eclipse. Run configurations are available for each worlds from the Stanford assignments.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You can for example share new worlds or new exercises. Just fork this repo and send a merge request.

> Note: please do not push the solutions to the Stanford assignments.

## Bugs and feature requests

Detailed installation instructions are available on my blog. Please read it carefully and post installation issues in the comments.

Anything else can be posted in the repository issues tracker.

## Copyright and license

The main code comes from the Stanford CS106A Programming Methodology course without license of any kind. All credit goes to Stanford and probably to Eric Roberts.
